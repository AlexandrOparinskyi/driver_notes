    Excellent! Let's create your first car! 🚙💨

    To start, simply name it ✏️. This is so you can easily find the car in the list.
    For example, you can use the make 🏷️, model 🚘, or even a nickname 🤩 – whatever is most convenient for you!

    Everything else – year 📅, engine ⚙️, mileage 🛣️ – can be added later at any time. I'll remind you 🔔 if anything is needed for calculations!

    So, what will we call your car? 😊

start-completed-add-car =
    Hooray! The car "{ $car_name }" has been added to the garage! 🎉🚗✨

    Now you can add more details 📊 – this way I can calculate statistics more accurately 📈 and remind you about maintenance 🔔.

    Or you can do it later ⏭️ – you can always return to editing from the menu 🔧.

    What do you choose? 🤔

start-confirm-text =
